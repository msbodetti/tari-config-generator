If things are working fine, then there's no need to change anything here. Each major section is clearly marked so that you can quickly find the section you're looking for.\n A note about Logging - The logger is initialised before the configuration file is loaded. For this reason, logging is not configured here, but in `~/.tari/log4rs.yml` (*nix / OsX) or `%HOME%/.tari/log4rs.yml` (Windows) by default, or the location specified in the TARI_LOGFILE environment variable."
